Although DAX was utilised for customer segmentation of age groups to make clearer distinctions, the dashboard highlights the limitations of the data collected. With detailed conclusions unable to be drawn, ultimately the business will be unable to provide definite calls to action for their marketing staff. Presenting the limitations of the data, however, will serve as a good starting point to fully understand what data is now needed on their clientele to best to target them.

This project would be best developed by further collecting data on the businesses customers and defining a typical customer profile. Data on - location, profession, gender, use of social media platforms and product serveys may provide useful information to best inform marketing strategy.
